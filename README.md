# satori-go

satori-go allows you to interact with the Satori platform to create server-based or mobile applications that use the RTM to publish and subscribe.

## Setup/Usage

```go
	go get github.com/ericdmann/satori-go
```
Publisher and subscription examples are located inside of `/examples`

### Create a client

```go
	rtmClient, err := rtm.NewClient(RTMEndpoint, RTMAppKey, RTMRoleName, RTMRoleSecret, true)
```

### Initialization properties
	RTMEndpoint   		//	See satori documentation for endpoint
	RTMAppKey     		//	See satori documentation for app key
	RTMRoleName   		//	See satori documentation for role name
	RTMRoleSecret 		//	See satori documentation for role secret
	Debug			//	Triggers logging on each RTM action


### Publish to a channel
Once a client has been created, publishing to a channel is quite simple.

```go
	rtWire, err := rtmClient.Publish(channel, time.Now().String())
```

### Subscribe to a channel
Each client can subscribe to exacly one channel at a time. Subscriptions can be changed without reconnecting.

```go
	err = rtmClient.Subscribe(channel)
```

### Cancelling a subscription
Because there is only one active subscription per client, you can cancel without providing a channel name.

```go
	err = rtmClient.CancelSubscription()
```

### Reading a subscription
Each client has a subscription channel `chan RTWire`. Trigger items to be pulled off of the socket and put on this channel by calling `ReadSubscription()`
```go
	go rtmClient.ReadSubscription()
	for {
		item := <-rtmClient.Subscription
		fmt.Println("(Received) : ", item.Body.Messages)
	}
```

### Example
Publisher and subscription examples are located inside of `/examples`

```go
	go run subscribe.go
```

###	Testing
Export all the necessary Satori fields into your environment by using the `export` built-in:

```
$ export SATORI_APP_KEY=<YOUR_SATORI_APP_KEY>
```

You can then just use `go test --cover`

```go
PASS
coverage: 82.2% of statements
ok	1.942s
```
